## Project Overview

DaasVader is an **decentralized Kubernetes service integrated with Sui blockchain**, an innovative project that replaces traditional centralized authentication systems with **blockchain-based staking mechanisms**. 

Users are consumers of Sui's Vercel serverless platform, and compute providers (stakers) are shared Kubernetes administrators. Using Sui Nautilus for master node and control plane operations with Move contracts, and utilizing Nautilus for secure communications and verification processes (master node      verification). The goal is to become Sui's Vercel.

### Vision: Sui's Vercel
- **Users**: Deploy applications seamlessly through blockchain contracts (serverless experience)
- **Stakers**: Provide compute resources and earn rewards as shared Kubernetes cluster administrators
- **Walrus Storage**: Replace OCI/DockerHub with Sui-native container registry
- **Move Contracts**: Handle all authentication, authorization, and resource allocation
- **Goal**: Create a fully decentralized, trustless alternative to traditional cloud platforms

### Core Innovation Points
- **Sui blockchain + K8s native integration**
- **Sui Native architecture** (Replace OCI/DockerHub with Walrus as Sui-native Container Registry)
- **Real-time event processing** (Sui events â†’ masternode execution)
- **Economic security model** (staking-based permission management)
- **Event-driven automation** (blockchain events trigger K8s operations)
